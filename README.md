# Predictive Modeling for House Prices

## Overview
This project leverages Python and machine learning to predict residential home prices based on a variety of features, including location, size, and amenities. The notebook guides users through cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation steps for practical real estate analytics.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numeric data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes home prices, feature distributions, and correlations using descriptive statistics and plots.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creates new predictive variables and selects relevant features for modeling.
- **Model Development:** Trains regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to forecast home prices.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assesses prediction accuracy using metrics like RMSE and R2 score, and compares model performance.
- **Results Visualization:** Presents price predictions and residual plots for direct interpretability.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/venkatbhaskar4u/House-Price-Prediction.git`
2. Download or verify the included housing dataset.
3. Open `House_Price_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run all cells to explore data, train models, and view predictions.

## Example Results
- Produces accurate estimated prices for test homes.
- Ranks feature importances and visualizes prediction errors.

## Applications & Impact
- Valuable for real estate analytics, property management, and investment forecasting.
- Demonstrates foundational data science and regression modeling skills sought in analytics and consulting roles.
